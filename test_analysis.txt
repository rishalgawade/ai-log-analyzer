Okay, I'm ready to analyze the Jenkins build log and provide a comprehensive breakdown of the failure.

## üîç Root Cause

The build failed because a test case in `test_api.py` asserted that the API should return a 200 status code, but it actually returned a 404.  This indicates that the API endpoint being tested is either not available or the test is configured incorrectly.

## üìç Error Location

*   **File:** `test_api.py`
*   **Line Number:** 42
*   **Error Message:** `AssertionError: Expected 200, got 404`

## üîß Recommended Fixes

1.  **Verify API Endpoint:**  First, manually check the API endpoint being tested using `curl` or a similar tool. Replace `<API_ENDPOINT>` with the actual URL used in the test.

    ```bash
    curl -I <API_ENDPOINT>
    ```

    Examine the HTTP status code returned. If it's 404, the endpoint is not available.

2.  **Investigate API Deployment:**  If the API endpoint is down or returning 404, investigate the API deployment process. Ensure the API is correctly deployed and running in the target environment. Check API server logs for errors.

3.  **Review Test Configuration:**  Examine line 42 in `test_api.py`.  Verify that the correct API endpoint is being targeted, and that any required authentication tokens or headers are being included in the request.  Double-check the URL and request parameters for typos or incorrect values.  For example, the test might look something like this:

    ```python
    # test_api.py
    import requests
    import unittest

    class TestAPI(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_api_endpoint(self):
            response = requests.get("<API_ENDPOINT>")  # Make sure this endpoint exists and is correct
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200) # Line 42

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    If the endpoint is correct, perhaps the server requires a specific header that isn't being included.
    ```python
    response = requests.get("<API_ENDPOINT>", headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer <TOKEN>'})
    ```
4.  **Check Environment Variables:** Ensure that environment variables used in the test or API configuration are correctly set in the Jenkins environment. Incorrect or missing environment variables can cause the API to fail or the test to target the wrong endpoint. Print the environment variables within the test to confirm. `print(os.environ)`
5.  **Re-run the test locally:** Run the failing test locally, mirroring the Jenkins environment as closely as possible. This can help isolate whether the problem is specific to the Jenkins environment or a more general issue.

## üí° Prevention Tips

*   **Implement Health Checks:** Add health check endpoints to your API that return a 200 status code when the API is healthy.  Monitor these health checks regularly.
*   **Automated API Testing in a Staging Environment:**  Run API tests in a dedicated staging environment *before* deploying to production. This can help catch issues early and prevent them from affecting users.  Include these tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
